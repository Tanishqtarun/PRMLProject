1. Project Overview

This project implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It aims to explore both linear and nonlinear classifiers, highlight their performance, and evaluate their real-world applicability, especially in real-time digit recognition systems like postal code readers or bank check digitizers.

2.Motivation
Handwriting recognition is a classic machine learning task with practical significance. Despite being well-studied, it offers valuable insights into:
Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
Model training and evaluation
Trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity
Generalization and overfitting behavior


üìÇ Dataset
Name: Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)
Source: Yann LeCun‚Äôs MNIST Database
Structure:
60,000 training images
10,000 testing images
Each image: 28x28 pixels (grayscale)
Labels: Digits from 0 to 9

3. Problem Statement

Train and evaluate models to accurately classify handwritten digits based on pixel values. The final system should support real-time digit recognition.

4. Progress So Far

Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collected and converted images to array format.
- Pixel values binarized:
  - 0 for pixel values between 0‚Äì100
  - 1 for pixel values between 100‚Äì255
- Saved dataset in CSV format.
- Data shuffled for unbiased training.

5.Model Training

Implemented and evaluated the following machine learning models:

- Linear Regression 
  - Used as a baseline classifier.
  - Performed poorly on classification due to its continuous output and inability to model complex patterns.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
  - Achieved significantly better accuracy.
  - Sensitive to the choice of distance metric and number of neighbors.
  - Issues: high memory usage, slow prediction time.

- Decision Tree 
  - Capable of learning non-linear boundaries.
  - Tends to overfit without pruning or regularization.

- Bayesian Classifier (Naive Bayes)  
  - Fast and memory-efficient.
  - Assumes feature independence, which may not hold in image data.
  - Still provided decent accuracy with minimal resource usage.

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Implemented with both linear and RBF kernels.
  - Provided high accuracy and good generalization.
  - Computationally intensive for large datasets.
